        <p class="text-body-1 mb-4">
          Hi, I'm <strong>Walden Hart</strong>, a recent
          <strong>Computer Science & Engineering</strong> graduate from
          <strong>Ohio State University</strong>. My focus is on
          <strong>full-stack development</strong> and
          <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, with experience building reliable and
          scalable systems.
        </p>

        <p class="text-body-1 mb-4">
          During my internship at <strong>OCLC</strong>, I contributed to
          large-scale information systems that support libraries and researchers
          worldwide. I've also been active in the
          <strong>OSU cybersecurity club</strong>, where I gained practical
          security experience through capture-the-flag competitions like
          BuckeyeCTF.
        </p>

        <p class="text-body-1 mb-4">
          I'm eager to continue growing as a
          <strong>full-stack developer</strong> and
          <strong>security-focused engineer</strong>, applying my skills to
          deliver high-quality, impactful software solutions.
